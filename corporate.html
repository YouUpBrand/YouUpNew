          <p>The website is a “teaser” pre-launch website to inform potential consumers on what our brand stands for. The website comprises of what services we offer as well as informing them of what the future holds regarding the events that we are organising. The pre-launch will be able to bring our team’s vision and values to life, which will lead to attracting the right audience which are 40-50-year-old middle aged singles who are looking for a sense of adventure in their dating lives.</p>
          


          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3> Colour scheme</h3>
              <p>As our team strived to go for lively colours in comparison to the dating market that uses undersaturated colours, we concluded upon choosing a colour palette that included the colour carmine red, orange, white, and beige. Orange defines spontaneity and creativity which intertwines with red that signifies passion, love, liveliness, and adventure, which intertwine with our brand’s visions. In addition, white signals clarity and openness whilst beige symbolises tranquillity and modernism as well as giving the brand an inviting and trending feel. The first version of the lean canvas states that the customer segments are 40-50-year-old middle aged singles who consist of men and women, thus we chose these lively colours to bring the under-saturation of the current digital dating world to life. </p>
              <ul class="list-unstyled">

              <h3>Font choices</h3><p>team decided to choose lively yet modern fonts such as Schibsted Grotesk Medium 500 and Schibsted Grotesk SemiBold 600 spontaneously whilst preparing for our Marketing presentation. The reasons as to why we chose these innovating fonts is because Schibsted Grotesk SemiBold 600 compliments our website’s headers exquisitely whilst maintaining a sleek look – we want to be able to compel our consumers to sign up via our website as well as staying satisfied during their scrolling sessions. Secondly, Schibsted Grotesk Regular 400 was chosen as our main font to upkeep the website’s conciseness and functionality and also allow consumers that visit our website to have an overly satisfactory readability level. As our team strives to compel 40 to 50-year olds that seek thrill and excitement, the fonts mentioned above give a sense of enthrallment; this aligns with the mood that we want to extract from our team to the consumers of fun and joy.

            </li>
            <li><h3> User interface patterns </h3> <p>The first interface element that was used in our website is called the dropdown menus, which is on the landing page of our website. Since the template already came with dropdown menus, our team made sure to make maximum use of them to ensure that our brand identity and visions are showcased to all people visiting the website. Our team kept the cognitive load of the website to a minimum to ensure an easy and efficient experience during the design aspect of the website. In addition, there are also buttons in the hero section of our page to compel users on the website to visit our other forms of social media. </p>

               <p>As our target audience are 40-50-year-old middle aged singles, we want to ensure that all our other social media platforms are available for them if they want to keep up with our services. There are text fields on the landing page as well as the other pages to add crucial forms of information to inform our users of what our services are about. Icons are also placed next to the dropdown menus of our company’s logo to add brand identity and to make the company’s logo memorable towards the consumers on the website. The icon is also hyperlinked for users who visit other pages from the landing page to bring them back to the main page for efficiency. The third version of the lean canvas states that our solution is to create a brand where our target group can create connections without the need for digital dating apps, thus having the necessary icons on the hero page which are hyperlinked to our YouTube and Facebook channels are crucial. </p>
              </li>
            <li><h3>Organisation of navigation and content </h3><p>With the use of Information Architecture (IA), we were able to create a successful landing page consisting of dropdown menus in order to bring the brand’s vision and mission to life. The menu system is placed clearly on the landing page for all users to easily navigate as our target audience consist of 40-50-year-old middle aged singles who have a comfortable to higher income, which indicates their higher level of knowledge in technology. By ensuring easy and navigable dropdown menu and hamburger menu, we allow users to explore the website freely whilst being informed on what the website and brand has to offer. The main page has an image of what the YouUp? brand is represented as, which is a skyscraper in which our intended target audience will visit to find their potential dating partners. Furthermore, our team made sure that the Responsive Design was efficient as the website needs to adhere to various screen sizes and devices such as smartphones and laptops. </p></li>

          <h4 id="production-3" class="mt-2">Testing Report</h4>
          <p>In order to ensure that our clients receive and visit the best possible website, we have conducted four user tests to assess whether our website meets our objectives. Our test group consisted of participants between the ages of 41 and 45, which aligns with our target audience demographic of individuals between the ages of 40 and 60. Thus, our testing goals are to give a highly satisfactory user and customer experience, and to ensure a Responsive Web Design. Participants were instructed to complete the following tasks: 

           </p> 1. Navigate to the 'About Us' section of the website. 
           <p></p> 2. Navigate to the 'Our Team' section of the website. 
           <p></p> 3. Navigate to the 'Locations' section of the website. 
           <p></p> 4. Scroll through the homepage of the website. 
           <p></p> 5. Locate the section that describes our brand values. 
          
           <p></p> The purpose of these tasks were to test the following aspects of our website: 
           <p></p> 1. The ease with which participants could navigate information about our company and our values. 
          <p></p>  2. The placement of images and links throughout the website. 
           <p></p> 3. Whether participants could gain insights into our brand and its values by simply scrolling through the website. 
           <p></p> 4. The overall readability and design of the website. 
            
           <p></p> We began the testing process by asking participants to complete the above tasks. Our aim was to measure the user-friendliness of our website and the speed with which participants were able to complete the tasks. Our team invited all of the intended target audience to come to Breda University of Applied Sciences to be able to gather them and attain results efficiently. The videos were recorded with an iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. Based on the feedback provided, we implemented changes to our website in order to improve its user-friendliness and overall design. 
            
            <p></p>From the testing we were able to conclude the following: 
           <p></p> 1. Users were happy with the overall look and feel of the website. They were able to navigate through the website under two minutes as well as successfully following all the tasks that were given.  
           <p></p> 2. Participant 1 mentioned the readability of the text on the home page – they wanted the text to be a bit bigger. What we would have implemented on the website are bigger texts, especially on the home page to satisfy our target audience in the future. 
           <p></p> 3. However, users informed us of the simplicity of the website – they wanted us to have more of a design on the website, the home page in particular. In the future, we would have added more UI/UX designs such as icons, bold font headers, and pictures on the home page. 
            </p>

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>Our brand vision is: In a world where technology has made dating more convenient, but less personal, we believe that building authentic connections is the key to inspiring meaningful relationships. We would help build a deeper connection. </p>
          
          <p>With brand values:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Euphoria</li>
            <li>Respect</li>
            <li>Freedom</li>
            <li>Adventure</li>
            <li>Embracing diversity</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Our brand wants to let single 40 to 50 year olds meet each other in our skyscraper. With each floor being a different activity so you do not have to go on a second date because you can start right then and there. There is a restaurant, club and a lot more. It is so people form a true connection in real life instead of via the internet. </p>
          <p>We used Facebook and YouTube for our promotional activities. To reach our objectives we posted regularly and tried to make engaging content. We posted about our events and building and did a giveaway.  </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>Our learning points are:</p>
          <p>Our objectives were too high in the beginning. Facebook and YouTube were difficult platforms to work with because our posts did not get shared in the algorithm. We managed to get more followers Facebook by posting even more. On YouTube this did not work and we researched what would work. We started to try and link the YouTube videos to our Facebook but due to the short period of time we do not know if this worked yet.</p>
          <p>Our strategy on Facebook seems to work when we post more regularly because that is the moment we gained more followers. On YouTube however there was no good posting strategy found, for the future we could see if more hashtags or sharing would work.  </p>
          <p>We did expect to gain followers and people being excited about our brand. However we did not expect the difficulties with Facebook and YouTube as main platforms. So for the future this is something we will keep in mind and immediately start posting regularly and linking the YouTube to other media platforms.  </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>With this project we have done marketing on YouTube and Facebook. In the end we have 17 followers on Facebook and a total of 16 likes. On YouTube we have a total of 0 subscribers and 0 likes. This result is less then we wanted to reach based upon our first objectives.  </p>
          <p>The execution of our project was in the beginning not well. We did not post regularly enough and this resulted in no likes or views on YouTube or Facebook. After two weeks we reflected on this and started posting more. This resulted in a growth of 16 likes on Facebook, this was a result we were pleased with. On YouTube we do not have a lot of views yet. To change this in the future we want more collaborations with bigger influencers so they can introduce us to the target group. We also want to start posting YouTube shorts to be in that algorithm.  </p>
